Square Function Plotter:
A simple Python program that visualizes the square function (y = x²) using matplotlib.
Description:
This program plots a parabola for x values ranging from -10 to 10, calculating y = x² for each point. The resulting graph displays a U-shaped curve with visual enhancements including colored lines, markers, and a grid.
Features:
Plots square function (y = x²)
X-axis range: -10 to 10
Green line connecting data points
Blue circular markers at each point
Grid background for easy reading
Labeled axes and title
Output:
The program generates a parabola graph showing:
Title: "Square Function"
X-axis: Values from -10 to 10
Y-axis: Squared values (0 to 100)
Visualization: Green line with blue markers
Code Structure:
Define x-values from -10 to 10
Calculate y-values (x²) using a loop
Configure plot settings (title, labels, grid)
Plot with custom styling
Display the graph
